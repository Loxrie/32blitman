Timer based ghost state progression.

Incompatible with 32blit and 32blit-beta.  Do not use.

Fix ghost eating bug.
Fix pause/resume debounce.
Fix pause/resume not pausing/resuming nec. timers. (needs pause() adding to blit::Timer)
Fix wrong colours assigned to ghosts.

To Do

  - Ghost state updates wonky around the house.
  - Ghost state timer, how the hell do we manage:
   - Pausing on state change to frightened.
   - Resuming timing on ghost rebirth.
   - Pausing/resuming on pause/resume not interfering with the above?


Perhaps being able to pause the game is more hassle than it's worth?
