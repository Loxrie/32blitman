- Opening the menu on the 32blit doesn't pause the game! :-(
- You can escape the maze during the tunnel warp.
- Pacman death anim.

TODO

- If you look at when the ghosts reverse direction in the beginning, plus the pacman speed, the arcade game ghosts are slightly faster.
- Arcade like 'freeze' on eating ghost?
- Pacman cornering is wrong.  Permit 45 degree angle corners for speed.  This doable with angular velocity and pixel approaches to "center" of a tile.
- Ghost cornering needs slowdown.
- Cruise Elroy.
- The ghosts "shortest path" algorithm seems to take account of the portals!
- Pill and ghost eaten sound effects.
