- Opening the menu on the 32blit doesn't pause the game! :-(
- You can escape the maze during the tunnel warp.

TODO

- In the arcade game is was possible, rarely, to pass through a ghost. It happens more often here with the same 1px collision precision.
- Arcade like 'freeze' on eating ghost?
- No chaining bonus for eating ghosts?  Was there one?
- Implement fruit.
- Pacman cornering is wrong.  Permit 45 degree angle corners for speed.
- Ghost cornering needs slowdown.
- Ghost vs Pacman speeds wonky?
- Cruise Elroy?
