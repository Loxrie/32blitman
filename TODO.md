- Speed changes means I've seen a few ghosts clip through walls!  Bottom right e.g.
- Opening the menu on the 32blit doesn't pause the game! :-(
- You can escape the maze during the tunnel warp.
- Pacman death anim.

TODO

- Arcade like 'freeze' on eating ghost?
- Pacman cornering is wrong.  Permit 45 degree angle corners for speed.  This doable with angular velocity and pixel approaches to "center" of a tile.
- Ghost cornering needs slowdown.
- Cruise Elroy.
- The arcade ghosts "shortest path" algorithm seems to take account of the portals!
- Ghost eaten and power dot sound effects.
