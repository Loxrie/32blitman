32blit version of Pacman

Warning:

Requires 32blit Timer::pause() support.  See [my fork](https://github.com/Loxrie/32blit-beta/tree/feature/pause)

If that changes isn't merged in I'll patch this requirement out.


More a learning exercise than anything. Now a playable game mimicking most of the ghost behaviour, except Cruise Elroy.

And these three analyses of Pacman:

Button "A" (z on my keyboard) starts the game/levels/game over as it stands now.
It's still not very efficient.
